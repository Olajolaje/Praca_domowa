  	<h1><i>One more reggae for the road</i></h1>
	<h4>Bill Lovelady</h4>

<p>She came from Madrid<br>
Just a crazy kid<br>
Met her down in Cadiz<br>
I think you know where that is<br>
<p></p>
I'd been travelling far<br>
Playing my guitar<br>
Pulling senoritas<br>
They said I played like Manitas<br>
<p></p>
Looking for a few pesetas<br>
Took a job as a singing waiter<br>
And drank tequila, danced the night away<br>
<p></p>
I was sprawled across the table<br>
And making love to a Spanish Betty Grable<br>
I never did get to know the lady's name<br>
<p></p>
One more reggae for the road<br>
Gotta sing it to you before I go<br>
Everybody!<br>
